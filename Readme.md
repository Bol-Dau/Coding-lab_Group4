#A documentation about the Hospital Data Monitoring $ Archival System.
The Hospital Data Monitoring & Archival System is a system built to
perform specifically two functions:

1.) Archiving log files of your choice
Archiving files helps in storing data, saving and managing space,
and it also helps in transfering the data, since archived files are
easier and simpler to transmit. Archieved files also store the
original permissions of the file, making it simple to restore files
to thier original form.
About the Hospital Monitoring & Archival System, it offers you the
opportunity to archieve any of the log files for your hospital.
After archiving a file, a new similar file is created, as the
monitoring for you patientss health metrics continues. Their
information can still be archieved, turning the iformation into a
cycle.
Thats the first beauty of our monitoring and archival system.

2.) Data Analysis
The Hospital Monitoring and Archival System doesn't only help you 
archive your log files, but it also helps you to analyze your data.
With the help of our system, you can pick which patient's health 
metrics to analyze. The analyzed data contains counts per device,
time stamp for the first and last entry for each device. 
This is the second beauty of our device.
